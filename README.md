Introduction
Chat models take a series of messages as input, and return a model-generated message as output.

Although the chat format is designed to make multi-turn conversations easy, it’s just as useful for single-turn tasks without any conversations (such as those previously served by instruction following models like text-davinci-003).

An example API call looks as follows:

####
# Note: you need to be using OpenAI Python v0.27.0 for the code below to work
```import openai

openai.ChatCompletion.create(
  model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
  messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Who won the world series in 2020?"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Where was it played?"}
    ]
)```
####
The main input is the messages parameter. Messages must be an array of message objects, where each object has a role (either “system”, “user”, or “assistant”) and content (the content of the message). Conversations can be as short as 1 message or fill many pages.

Typically, a conversation is formatted with a system message first, followed by alternating user and assistant messages.

The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. In the example above, the assistant was instructed with “You are a helpful assistant.”

The user messages help instruct the assistant. They can be generated by the end users of an application, or set by a developer as an instruction.

The assistant messages help store prior responses. They can also be written by a developer to help give examples of desired behavior.

Including the conversation history helps when user instructions refer to prior messages. In the example above, the user’s final question of “Where was it played?” only makes sense in the context of the prior messages about the World Series of 2020. Because the models have no memory of past requests, all relevant information must be supplied via the conversation. If a conversation cannot fit within the model’s token limit, it will need to be shortened in some way.
